## Where Did I Get These?
I find wallpapers in a number of different locations but good places to check out include [Unsplash](http://unsplash.com) and [Reddit](http://www.reddir.com/r/wallpapers).  Some of the wallpapers were probably included in default wallpaper packages from various Linux distributions that I have installed over the years.

## Style of Wallpapers
The vast majority of these wallpapers are nature and landscape photos.  There are a few abstract art wallpapers mixed in. Most of the images are in a horizontal orientation but there is a subfolder containing images in a vertical orientation. There is also a number of subfolders containing grouped images.

## Ownership
Because I downloaded most of these from various sites/sources, I have no way of knowing if there is a copyright on these images. If you find an image hosted in this repository that is yours and of limited use, please let me know and I will remove it.
